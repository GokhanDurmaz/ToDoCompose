Navigation Component
1.  More than one NavHost can be used but each NavHost has its own NavControllers.

Compose with Navigation Component
1. val navController = rememberNavController(), there is a usage in this way.

View with Navigation Component
1.  - For Fragments,  Fragment.findNavController()
    - For Views,      View.findNavController()
    - For Activities, Activity.findNavController(viewId: Int)

How to use and access to NavHost
1.  val navHostFragment =
        supportFragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.nav_host_fragment) as NavHostFragment
    val navController = navHostFragment.navController

    The Fragment Id is given to findFragmentById(id: Int) method then it is casted as NavHostFragment
    and it can access to NavHost with this method.


FragmentContainerView and FragmentTransaction causes a problem when:
1. If you use Navigation.findNavController(Activity, @IdRes int) onCreate of Activity, so
You should retrieve the NavController directly from the NavHostFragment instead.
